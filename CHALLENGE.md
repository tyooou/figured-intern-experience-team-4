# üåæ Figured Intern Experience Challenge

Welcome to the Figured Intern Experience! Your mission is to transform raw financial data into a beautiful, interactive Profit & Loss report that helps farmers and accountants make better business decisions.

## üéØ The Challenge

You'll build a stunning financial reporting interface that showcases a farm's financial performance across different enterprises (Sheep, Wheat, Barley) with interactive features and professional styling.

### What You'll Build

Create a visually appealing Profit & Loss report using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS that displays financial data from our API endpoint. The report should be intuitive, professional, and help users quickly understand the farm's financial story.

## üìä The Financial Data

Your data comes from a real farm operation called "Pam Testing Farm Operations" covering:

- **Time Period**: April 2025 - March 2026 (Actuals + Forecast)
- **Groups**: Sheep farming, Wheat production, Barley cultivation
- **Categories**: Income, Costs, Operating Expenses
- **Rich Details**: Monthly breakdowns, account-level granularity

**API Endpoint**: `/api/financial-report`

## ‚úÖ Core Requirements

### 1. **Visual Design & Styling**

- Use **Tailwind CSS** exclusively for styling
- Create a professional, clean design that looks like a real accounting report
- Use appropriate colors, typography, and spacing
- Make negative numbers clearly distinguishable (red/parentheses)

### 2. **Data Display**

- Show at least **3 key financial metrics** prominently (e.g., Total Income, Net Profit, Gross Profit)
- Display the company information (name, report type, period)
- Present data in a logical, hierarchical structure
- Format numbers appropriately (thousands separators, currency symbols)
- Clear nesting levels (indentation, borders, colors)

### 3. **Vue.js Implementation**

- Use Vue 3 composition API or options API (your choice)
- Implement reactive data fetching from the API
- Use Vue directives effectively (v-for, v-if, v-show, etc.)
- Handle loading and error states gracefully

### 4. **Code Quality**

- Clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Proper component structure and organization
- Appropriate use of Vue reactivity and lifecycle hooks

## üé® Design Inspiration

Think of professional financial reports you've seen:

- Clean tables with alternating row colors
- Clear hierarchy with indentation
- Professional typography and spacing
- Subtle borders and dividers
- Color coding for different data types

## üöÄ Stretch Goals (Optional but Impressive!)

### **LLM Financial Commentary**

Use the included **Prism package** to generate AI-powered insights about the financial data:

- **Setup**: We'll provide an OpenAI API key on challenge day
- **Integration**: Use Prism to send financial data to OpenAI
- **Commentary**: Generate insights about trends, concerns, or opportunities
- **Display**: Show AI commentary alongside relevant financial sections

#### Example Commentary Topics:

- "Sheep operations are performing well with strong sales in Q1..."
- "Operating expenses spike in July suggests investigating cost controls..."
- "Forecast shows recovery potential in the wheat enterprise..."

#### Prism Implementation Hints:

```php
// In your controller or service
use EchoLabs\Prism\Facades\Prism;

$response = Prism::text()
    ->using('openai', 'gpt-4')
    ->withPrompt(
    "Moo there! I‚Äôm Otis, your barnyard financial guru.
    Take a look at this farm financial data: "
    . json_encode($financialData) .
    ". Tell me where the cash cows are and where we‚Äôre just shoveling money into the mud.
    Break it down into income, expenses, and profit, then give me some udderly brilliant
    recommendations to fatten up the farm‚Äôs wallet."
)

    ->generate();
```

## üí° Technical Tips & Tricks

### **Vue.js Tips**

- Use `computed` properties for calculated totals
- Use `watch` to react to data changes
- Component composition can help organize complex nested structures

### **Tailwind CSS Tips**

- Use spacing utilities consistently (`p-4`, `mb-6`, `space-y-2`)
- Color utilities for financial data (`text-red-600`, `text-green-600`)
- Grid and flexbox utilities for layout (`grid`, `flex`, `justify-between`)

### **Data Handling Tips**

- The API returns structured data with `sections`, `subsections`, and `line_items`
- Each line item has a `values` array matching the column structure
- Use array methods like `reduce()` for calculating totals
